## 1 - Description
Upon opening the application, the user is prompted to register an account and login.
This will bring the user to the home page which portrays the official game. Along with the game,
there will be a button that allows the user to look at the instructions on how to play the game.
The game is called “Weatherdle” in which the user is given weather facts, including
average temperature, average clouds, and yearly precipitation for guessing a city by weather
information. Upon each guess the user gives, it is then compared to the actual answer, and the
application outputs hints based on that guess, such as how high or low the average temperature
is of the city they guessed compared to that of the answer.
After the user has correctly guessed the city, they are then prompted with a sort of
leaderboard showing their statistics such as the number of times played, win percentage, and
current streak. They are also shown how many guesses it took them each time they played.
